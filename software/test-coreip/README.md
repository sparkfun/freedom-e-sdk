# test-coreip
Assembly test code which executes instructions and checks for expected results.
The framework in this test allows functionality from https://github.com/riscv/riscv-tests to be used directly within the top level source file and executed in RTL Simulation or on the Arty FPGA board, where, upon completion, it will return the appropriate test finisher code to demonstrate pass or fail functionality.
